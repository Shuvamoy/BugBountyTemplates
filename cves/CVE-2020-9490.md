Note: This is a DOS vulnerability, before reporting I've read the program's description and it was not explicitly out of scope.

The version $VERSION is vulnerable to server crash using a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. More details [CVE-2020-9490.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9490)

It's possible to obtain the version of some Apache servers in the Response Header for a GET Request.

To check the vulnerable version just run `curl -skI $URL |grep Apache` and check for $VERSION

We can also check if HTTP/2 is supported running the following command `curl -sIk $URL| grep "HTTP/2"` (if supported the output will be HTTP/2 301). 


Steps To Reproduce:

It requires Python 2. 

1. Install hyper and ssl 
>  pip install hyper ssl or pip2 install hyper ssl
2. Download the following code [POC] 
> wget https://gist.github.com/pdelteil/501f854f8d4c86372952631f8bf8fda7/raw/c6bbe01cd08d7fa208eac23fbcdd51aec4960be8/CVE-2020-9490.py

3 Execute the code with one of the servers.

 > python CVE-2020-9490.py $DOMAIN $PORT OR 

>  python2 CVE-2020-9490.py $DOMAIN $PORT
(repeat 5 times)

4. Check if server is still running.
    [I didn't do it, don't want any of your servers to crash]


## Impact

Server crash of the specified machine.
